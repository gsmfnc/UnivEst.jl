identification examples:

duffing - first overview of the method
try also adding time derivatives, like fix a time interval [0, 5] and see if it
converges faster with or without time derivatives
for obs example 3

lorenz - without changing coordinates!
--> look at example 4 in system identification ejc template
for obs example 2 and 5

fq1 - use a neural network as phi
for obs example 4

cs1
for obs example 1

(maybe) sprottq - consider an output function that is also parameterized
